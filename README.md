# Deeper Than the Game: Investigating Racial Dynamics and Health Implications in the NFL
## Project Overview
"Deeper Than the Game" is a comprehensive investigation into the racial dynamics within the NFL's structure and the long-term health implications for athletes. This project combines research analysis, utilizing various theoretical frameworks, with statistical analysis to explore how racial disparities and health risks impact NFL players.
## Motivation
As a former student-athlete, I have seen firsthand the motivations and resilience of collegiate football athletes motivations, as well as the pressure put on them by their coaches. The unfortunate loss of a fellow athlete to heat exhaustion at my former college led me to look into the factors that drive these athletes to  push beyond their limits. This project was not only an academic pursuit but also a personal investigation into why these athletes make these sacrifices in order to pursue greatnesss.
## Technologies Used
Adobe Photoshop: Used for text and enhancing graphics created in Illustator.
Adobe Illustrator: Design of infographics and data representations. 
Tableau: data visualization and analysis. 
SQL: Data analysis 
## Challenges
One of the main challenges I faced was the limited availability of statistics on concussions and injuries within the NFL. I relied on a single dataset from Kaggle, so the statistical analysis provided here provides some insights but there are a lot of constraints as I am acknowledging currently.
# Project Components
Research Paper: The core of this project, a detailed analysis utilizing theoretical frameworks to examine the complexities of racial dynamics and health from the foundation (primary school) to the league. 
Statistical Analysis: Used to find injury patterns within the NFL based on available data.
Visualizations: Interactive dashboards and infographics to convey data in an understandable form.
